A small and easy-to-use one-time password generator for Java according to [RFC 4226](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226) (HOTP) and [RFC 6238](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238) (TOTP).

## Features
The following features are supported:
1. Generation of secrets
2. Time-based one-time password (TOTP, RFC 6238) generation based on current time, specific time, OTPAuth URI and more for different HMAC algorithms.
3. HMAC-based one-time password (HOTP, RFC 4226) generation based on counter and OTPAuth URI.
4. Verification of one-time passwords
5. Generation of OTP Auth URI's

## Installation

## Usage
### HOTP (Counter-based one-time passwords)
#### Initialization HOTP instance
To create a `HOTP` instance, use the `HOTP.Builder` class as follows:

```java
byte[] secret = "VV3KOX7UQJ4KYAKOHMZPPH3US4CJIMH6F3ZKNB5C2OOBQ6V2KIYHM27Q".getBytes();
HOTP.Builder builder = new HOTP.Builder(secret);
HOTP hotp = builder.build();
```
The above builder creates a HOTP instance with default values for passwordLength = 6 and algorithm = SHA1. Use the builder to change these defaults:
```java
HOTP.Builder builder = new HOTP.Builder(secret);
builder
  .withPasswordLength(8)
  .withAlgorithm(HMACAlgorithm.SHA256);

HOTP hotp = builder.build();
```

When you don't already have a secret, you can let the library generate it:
```java
// To generate a secret with 160 bits
byte[] secret = SecretGenerator.generate();

// To generate a secret with a custom amount of bits
byte[] secret = SecretGenerator.generate(512);
```

It is also possible to create a HOTP instance based on an OTPAuth URI. When algorithm or digits are not specified, the default values will be used.
```java
URI uri = new URI("otpauth://hotp/issuer?secret=ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP&algorithm=SHA1&digits=6&counter=8237");
HOTP hotp = HOTP.fromURI(uri);
```

Get information about the generator:

```java
byte[] secret = hotp.getSecret();
int passwordLength = hotp.getPasswordLength(); // 6
HMACAlgorithm algorithm = hotp.getAlgorithm(); // HMACAlgorithm.SHA1
```

#### Generation of HOTP code
After creating an instance of the HOTP class, a code can be generated by using the `generate()` method:
```java
try {
    int counter = 5;
    String code = hotp.generate(counter);
    
    // To verify a token:
    boolean isValid = hotp.verify(code, counter);
    
    // Or verify with a delay window
    boolean isValid = hotp.verify(code, counter, 2);
} catch (IllegalStateException e) {
    // Handle error
}
```

### TOTP (Time-based one-time passwords)
#### Initialization TOTP instance
TOTP can accept more paramaters: `passwordLength`, `period`, `algorithm` and `secret`. The default values are: passwordLength = 6, period = 30 and algorithm = SHA1.

```java
// Generate a secret (or use your own secret)
byte[] secret = SecretGenerator.generate();

TOTP.Builder builder = new TOTP.Builder(secret);

builder
    .withPasswordLength(6)
    .withAlgorithm(HMACAlgorithm.SHA1) // SHA256 and SHA512 are also supported
    .withPeriod(Duration.ofSeconds(30));

TOTP totp = builder.build();
```
Or create a `TOTP` instance from an OTPAuth URI:
```java
URI uri = new URI("otpauth://totp/issuer?secret=ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP&algorithm=SHA1&digits=6&period=30");
TOTP totp = TOTP.fromURI(uri);
```

Get information about the generator:
```java
byte[] secret = totp.getSecret();
int passwordLength = totp.getPasswordLength(); // 6
HMACAlgorithm algorithm = totp.getAlgorithm(); // HMACAlgorithm.SHA1
Duration period = totp.getPeriod(); // Duration.ofSeconds(30)
```

#### Generation of TOTP code
After creating an instance of the TOTP class, a code can be generated by using the `now()` method, similarly with the HOTP class:
```java
try {
    String code = totp.now();
     
    // To verify a token:
    boolean isValid = totp.verify(code);
} catch (IllegalStateException e) {
    // Handle error
}
```
The above code will generate a time-based one-time password based on the current time. The API supports, besides the current time, the creation of codes based on `timeSince1970` in seconds, `Date`, and `Instant`:

```java
try {
    // Based on current time
    totp.now();
    
    // Based on specific date
    totp.at(new Date());
    
    // Based on seconds past 1970
    totp.at(9238346823);
    
    // Based on an instant
    totp.at(Instant.now());
} catch (IllegalStateException e) {
    // Handle error
}
```

### Generation of OTPAuth URI's
To easily generate a OTPAuth URI for easy on-boarding, use the `getURI()` method for both `HOTP` and `TOTP`. Example for `TOTP`:
```java
TOTP totp = new TOTP.Builder(secret).build();

URI uri = totp.getURI("issuer", "account"); // otpauth://totp/issuer:account?period=30&digits=6&secret=SECRET&algorithm=SHA1

```

## Recovery Codes
Often, services provide "backup codes" or "recovery codes" which can be used when the user cannot access the 2FA device anymore. Often because 2FA device is a mobile phone, which can be lost or stolen. 

Because recovery code generation is not part of the specifications of OTP, it is not possible to generate recovery codes with this library and should be implemented seperately.
